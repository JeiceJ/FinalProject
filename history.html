          Amiibo is a toy-to-life platform created by Nintendo, which was first introduced in November 2014. Amiibo figurines feature various characters from Nintendoâ€™s catalog of games, such as Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Kirby, and Animal Crossing. These figurines connect to the Wii U, Nintendo 3DS, and Nintendo Switch systems via a wireless protocol. Initially, Amiibo served as both collectibles and game-enhancers.

          Over the years, the popularity of Amiibo has gradually declined. Fewer game software titles support the figurines, and they are now primarily sold as collectibles rather than a means to interact and unlock various features within games.
