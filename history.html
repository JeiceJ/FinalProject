          Amiibo is a toys-to-life platform created by Nintendo which was first
          introduced in November 2014. Amiibo figurines used various characters
          from Nintendo’s catalogue of games such as Mario, The Legend of Zelda,
          Kirby, and Animal Crossing. These figurines are similar in form and
          functionality to other toys-to-life platforms avaialble at the time
          such as Skylanders™, developed by Toys for Bob and published by
          Activision, Disney Infinity™, developed by Avalanche Software and
          published by Disney Interactive Studios, and Lego Dimensions™,
          developed by Traveller's Tales and published by Warner Bros.
          Interactive Entertainment. Amiibo was a direct response to this
          cultural phenomenon. Amiibo come in different shapes and sizes. You
          can find high-quality character figures or portable cards. To use
          them, you tap an amiibo to the right Joy-Con™ controller’s Right Stick
          on Nintendo Switch™, the NFC touchpoint on the Nintendo Switch Pro
          Controller, or the NFC reader on your Wii U™ GamePad controller. New
          Nintendo 2DS™ XL and New Nintendo 3DS™ XL systems have built-in amiibo
          support. You can also use amiibo with Nintendo 3DS™ systems via the
          Nintendo 3DS NFC Reader/Writer accessory.
