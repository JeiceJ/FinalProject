          Amiibo is a toys-to-life platform created by Nintendo which was first
          introduced in November 2014. Amiibo figurines used various characters
          from Nintendo’s catalogue of games such as Mario, The Legend of Zelda,
          Kirby, and Animal Crossing. These figurines are similar in form and
          functionality to other toys-to-life platforms avaialble at the time
          such as Skylanders™, developed by Toys for Bob and published by
          Activision, Disney Infinity™, developed by Avalanche Software and
          published by Disney Interactive Studios, and Lego Dimensions™,
          developed by Traveller's Tales and published by Warner Bros.
          Interactive Entertainment. Amiibo was a direct response to this
          cultural phenomenon.Amiibo come in different shapes and sizes. You can
          find high-quality character figures or portable cards. To use them,
          you tap an amiibo to the right Joy-Con™ controller’s Right Stick on
          Nintendo Switch™, the NFC touchpoint on the Nintendo Switch Pro
          Controller, or the NFC reader on your Wii U™ GamePad controller. New
          Nintendo 2DS™ XL and New Nintendo 3DS™ XL systems have built-in amiibo
          support, and you can also use amiibo with Nintendo 3DS™ systems via
          the Nintendo 3DS NFC Reader/Writer accessory. There are various lines
          of amiibo figures such as the Super Smash Bros.™ Series, The Legend of
          Zelda™ Series, The Splatoon™ Series, The Pokémon™ Series, etc. There
          are even some amiibo with unique variants such as the Golden Mario
          amiibo that was released alongside Mario Party 10 on the Wii U in
          2015. Amiibo often ran out of stock quickly, and some amiibo were only
          available at certain locations. For instance, the character Shulk,
          from Xenoblade Chronicles™, had an amiibo that was exlusivley
          available at GameStop in North America. The character Meta Knight,
          from the Kirby™ series also had an exclusive amiibo figure at Best Buy
          locations in North America. While many did buy amiibo for their use in
          games to earn various rewards like cosmetics for your Mii Character in
          Mario Kart™ 8, or to train your very own custom fighter in Super Smash
          Bros.™ for Wii U, many people simply bought amiibo for the novelty of
          having a figurine of your favorite Nintendo character. It was more
          about collecting than usage in games. This is part of why the
          popularity of amiibo started to fall.
